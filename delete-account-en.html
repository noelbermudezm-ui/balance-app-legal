        <h1>Account and Data Deletion for Balance App</h1>

        <p>
            We understand the importance of having control over your personal information. In Balance App, we offer a simple and direct way to permanently delete your account and all associated data.
        </p>

        <h2>How to request your account deletion?</h2>
        <p>
            You can delete your account and all your data directly from the application. Follow these steps:
        </p>

        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the <strong>Balance</strong> app on your device.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap on your profile icon or initials, located in the <strong>top-right corner</strong> of the main screen to go to <strong>"Settings"</strong>.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> In the "Account" section, find and press the red button that says <strong>"Delete All My Data"</strong>.
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> The application will ask for a final confirmation to ensure it is not a mistake. Upon confirmation, the deletion process will begin immediately.
        </div>

        <h2>What data is deleted?</h2>
        <p>
            By confirming the deletion, the following data will be **permanently and irreversibly** erased from our servers:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your profile information (name, email address).</li>
            <li>All expense and income records you have entered.</li>
            <li>All budgets you have configured.</li>
            <li>All savings goals and their history.</li>
            <li>All fixed expenses, debts, and loans recorded.</li>
            <li>Receipt images that you have uploaded.</li>
            <li>Your custom settings (categories, payers, payment methods, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>
                <strong>Note on receipt images:</strong> To optimize storage and protect your privacy, the receipt images you upload are **automatically deleted from our systems 90 days after their upload date**, regardless of whether you delete your account or not. When requesting account deletion, any image still within that 90-day period will also be deleted immediately.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            The process is automatic, and we do not keep any backups of your personal data once the deletion is complete. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at <strong>soporte.balanceapp@gmail.com</strong>.
